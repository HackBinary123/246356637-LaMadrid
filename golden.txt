I was a ghost, I was alone
Eoduwojin apgilsoge (Hah)
Given the throne, I didn't know how to believe (Hah)
I was the queen that I'm meant to be (Ah)
I lived two lives, tried to play both sides
But I couldn't find my own place (Oh, oh)
Called a problem child, 'cause I got too wild
But now that's how I'm getting paid, kkeuteopsi on stage

I'm done hidin', now I'm shinin'
Like I'm born to be
We dreamin' hard, we came so far
Now I believe


We're goin' up, up, up
It's our moment
You know together we're glowing
Gonna be, gonna be goldеn
Oh, up, up, up
With our voices
Yeongwonhi kkaejil su еomneun
Gonna be, gonna be golden

Oh, I'm done hidin' now I'm shinin'
Like I'm born to be
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be

Waited so long to break these walls down
To wake up and feel like me
Put these patterns all in the past now
And finally live like the girl they all see

No more hiding, I'll be shining
Like I'm born to be
'Cause we are hunters, voices strong
And I know I believe

We're goin' up, up, up
It's our moment
You know together we're glowing
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, up, up, up
With our voices
Yeongwonhi kkaejil su eomneun
Gonna be, gonna be golden
[Post-Chorus: All]
Oh, I'm done hidin', now I'm shinin'
Like I'm born to be
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be

You know we're gonna be, gonna be golden (Oh)
We're gonna be, gonna be (Oh)
Born to be, born to be glowin' (Oh)
Balkge bitnaneun urin
You know that it's our time, no fears, no lies (Oh, oh)
That's who we're born to be
